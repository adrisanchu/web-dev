# canvas-js

This section contains different canvas animations.
The objectives were:
* To jump into JS in a fun way.
* To learn how to deal with DOM events.
* To implement Object-Oriented Programming.
* To get started with Bootstrap.

*Kudos:* These animations where created following a series of videos from [@christopher4lis](https://github.com/christopher4lis) that you can find on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO6OkltgudE&t=232s), so if you're interested go check that out!
The whiteboard comes from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GqUM4mEYKA) by [DevEdwin](https://github.com/DevEdwin)
